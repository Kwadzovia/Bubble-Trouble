# Bubble-Trouble
Fun little python game

I made this one a while back on my first co-op when I was learning python for the first time.
Unfortunately I lost the actual python code since I wasn't using version control when I made it...
Your firewall might complain when trying to run it, but take a look at the gif if you want to see what its like!
